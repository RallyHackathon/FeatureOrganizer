===========================

A way to review and create new parents for incoming feature requests.  

Developed during the fall 2012 hackathon.  Here's a video: http://screencast.com/t/guLXYNESiG

Given a set of customer requests that are all marked as individual stories and
a set of features that we wish to implement represented as parent stories, review
the list of requests and either

* drag them into the appropriate stories so that we can see features that are often requested, or
* select several requests to group and create a parent story/feature for them.
* Create an executable version of the feature request to push into team planning

In process:
* select a request to see what features might be related based on matching keywords

Next:
* Rank feature requests based on scoring criteria
* Determine criteria for limiting which feature requests are displayed
